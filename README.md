# DataDome
This tutorial is for informational purposes only. I guess you'll add the code to your scripts, go ahead but quote me, thanks.

## How to bypass it?
Basically you need a cookie called "datadome", to get it you need to solve the captcha on the page (It isn't a reCaptcha like on starcow) and send some requests.
In the "pages_examples" folder i'll load some DataDome html pages, to let you familiarize with it
Read [my article on medium](https://medium.com/@campo1312/how-to-detect-block-and-manage-datadome-c6e94c74a4f4) for more detailed infos.
